#Jovin's contribution for the PayID Feature
To improve the usaability of the mobile app, i have contributed a user story and description  of the pay id scanner.
This feature will be allowing the users to scan a qr code containing the id of the reciever.
It decreases the chances of manual entry error.
This function eliminates the requirement of copy paste of the details of PayId, saves time and improve the accuracy of transaction.
My proposal: user taps Scan PAYiD button and app auto fills payment details .
Additional proposals: UI placements and accessibility, made sure scanner icon is clearly visible acroos multiple devices.
